Testing :
Software testing is a process to identify the correctness of the software
developed by testing and evaluating all the functionality to identify the possible errors and bugs to remove the possible defects.

Software bugs may arise due to system design or source code.
maven 
Errors are compile time or runtime issues which are generated at system level and needs to be handled.

Types of Testing : 
->Manual Testing :
manpower
reliability is not ensured properly.
correctness is not ensured
increased overhead costing of software development.
time consuming
->Automated Testing
software : JUnit,JTester
reliable
correctness is ensured.
overhead costing is standardised.
faster than manual testing.
->Tools used
-->Junit(java testing)
-->JTester(java testing)
-->Selenium(java testing)
-->Cypress(front end testing)

Manual testing tool :
->JIRA

int add(int a,int b)
{
    return a+b;
}
manual testing :
black box testing : 
-->done by random group of people.

white box testing
-->done by team of software engineers itself.
-->technical group of people.

test cases(manually by the developer)

->JUnit
-->provides the functionality of unit testing.
-->unit testing means one can test the functionality of the smallest module (methods) of the program.
-->Junit belongs to the family of xUnit testing.

-->Benefits
->open source framework
->it shows progress bar to communicate the output of test cases.
->works faster and ensures quality.
->Junit runs automatically,tests the functionality and generates the report of successful and failed test cases.
->it works on annotations.

annotations :
->annotations are used to communicate the metadata associated.
->used as tags to provide the required information to the system.
-> @ is the symbol used to specify annotation followed by the name.

@test
@before
@after
@afterclass
@beforeclass
